<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>With the advent of various swift
data acquisition systems and recent developments in the internet technology,
huge amounts of data have been amassed in different forms. The bursting need
for identifying some interpretable and valuable information from these large
datasets has never been more important than it is today. Data analytics deals with
the development of robust algorithms for nontrivial extraction of hidden and
potentially useful information from massive amounts of data. In the last
decade, data analytics has emerged as one of the most promising and challenging
areas in computer science. This course is mainly designed for beginning/senior
graduate students who are interested in understanding and applying various data
mining concepts to real-world problems. This course will be very useful to
students whose interests are in the areas of artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, bioinformatics, high-performance computing, database systems, and pattern recognition.  

This course will primarily consist of the following three modules: 1) Analyzing different forms of data (such as text data, time-series data, web data); 2) Various kinds of algorithms (such as embedding methods, semi-supervised learning, probabilistic models, regression analysis) and 3) Different types of application domains (such as social networks, recommender systems). This course will also discuss various data management issues such as chosing the right platform for data analytics and mechanisms for data warehousing.

<p><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="HOMEWORKS">Homework Assignments</A>:</FONT></LI>
</p>
<p>There will be four written homework assignments. Homework problems will constitute some programming exercises that are designed to understand the working of data analytics algorithms. Students are encouraged to talk and discuss with other students to improve their conceptual understanding, but the final submission must be their own work. If any help is taken from others, please acknowledge the people from whom you received some help. Any homework turned in late will incur some penalty for each late day. </p>

<p><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="QUIZZES">Quizzes</A></LI>:</FONT> </p>
<p> There will be five in-class quizzes. The best four out of the five will be considered for the final grade in the course. Each quiz will be 15-20 minutes long and will contain some basic questions about the course topics. The questions can be in the form of fill-in the blanks, multiple choice or simple calculations. Detailed algorithms or coding questions will not be present in the quiz. </p>

<p><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A NAME="EXAMS">Paper Readings</A></LI>:</FONT> </p>
<p> The students will need to write rigorous critiques for two research papers from the list provided under the "Readings" section on the course website. Each critique must be around 2 pages long (single-spaced) and should clearly highlight the problem motivation, background, the main intuition and algorithmic insights along with the main results. The critique should provide own thoughts as opposed to merely reproducing the paper's content. The papers related to the student's course project are strongly recommended.</p>

<p>One of the major components of this course is the final project. In this project, students will investigate some interesting aspect of deep learning and apply it to a real-world problem. The main purpose of this project is to enable the students to get some hands-on experience in the design and implementation of a practical data analytics system. In addition to the core algorithmic aspects, the performance of the system significantly depends on some specific domain-dependent expert knowledge in the application field (such as business intelligence, social networks, recommender systems, text analysis, imaging, e-commerce, etc.).  More details about the project proposal and project submission will be provided at a later time.  </p>
